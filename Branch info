this branch is created for the following reasons:

1) remove the body effect from consideration in all design cases, as it was concluded from the analysis that there is no gain dependance on the body effect.

2) remove the vds calculation part that we added recently, assuming all vds = vdd/3, as the vds doesn't have a big impact on the design for now.
