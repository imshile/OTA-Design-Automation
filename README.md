# OTA-Design-Automation
Project that introduces an automation to analog ICs, especially OTA different terminology using gm/ID terminology
in this branch i added a feature that asks the user to make a simple schematic with a nmos & pmos (details are in code comments), which makes the code can run on every technology and extends the design domain, instead of writing a netlist in a char array.
